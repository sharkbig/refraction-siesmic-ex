# refraction-siesmic-ex

This pyhton script is able to do simple inversion from refraction seismic data.

First, you need to picking the first arrival of for each shot.

Next, determine the cross-over distance of the direct wave and refraction wave, and calculate the velocity of the direct wave.

Third, save the refraction wave data as the format of example file: layer2.csv. (column: shot father; row: receiver gather)
And run the script as the guide in the layer2_inversion.py.
